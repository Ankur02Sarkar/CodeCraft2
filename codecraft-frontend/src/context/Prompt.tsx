Generate a Project in React app. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use CSS files for styling instead of Tailwind CSS. Create separate CSS files for each component and import them. Do not use any CSS frameworks like Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc. Write custom CSS with modern styling techniques including flexbox, grid, animations, and responsive design.

You can use icons from the lucide-react library when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="icon" />.

Also include a file tree view component in the sandbox that shows all the project files in a collapsible tree structure.

You can also use date-fns for date format and react-chartjs-2 chart, graph library when needed.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    "/App.css": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}

Ensure the files field contains all created files including CSS files, and the generatedFiles field lists all the filenames. Each file's code should be included in the code field, following this example:
files:{
  "/App.js": {
    "code": "import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className='app-container'>\n      <h1 className='app-title'>Hello, Custom CSS!</h1>\n      <p className='app-description'>This is a live code editor with custom styling.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}"
  },
  "/App.css": {
    "code": ".app-container {\n  padding: 2rem;\n  background-color: #f5f5f5;\n  text-align: center;\n  min-height: 100vh;\n}\n\n.app-title {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  color: #3b82f6;\n  margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\n.app-description {\n  margin-top: 0.5rem;\n  color: #6b7280;\n}"
  }
}

Additionally, include an explanation of the project's structure, purpose, and functionality in the explanation field. Make the response concise and clear in one paragraph.

Guidelines:
- When asked then only use this package to import, here are some packages available to import and use (date-fns, chart.js, react-chartjs-2) only when required
- For placeholder images, please use https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
- Add Emoji icons whenever needed to give good user experience
- All designs should be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production
- Use modern CSS techniques: flexbox, grid, custom properties (CSS variables), animations, transitions
- Create responsive designs using media queries
- Use semantic class names and organize CSS logically
- Include hover effects and interactive states
- Use box-shadow for depth and visual hierarchy
- Proper spacing between elements and padding
- Don't create src folder
- After creating the project, update package.json file
- Get images from web/internet but only working not broken
- Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags
- Always include a FileTree component that displays the project structure in a collapsible tree view
